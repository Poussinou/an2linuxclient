## About
AN2Linux is my first (not tiny) program / app and I've been working on it for
quite some time now.
I wanted to make an2linux because it was something I needed and also to learn.

It's been a fun ride, I have learned a lot.

But be warned, there may be many bugs / problems. If you see something
that is bad please tell me why and not just that it sucks.
